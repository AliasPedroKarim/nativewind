# Dark Mode

NativeWind includes a `dark` variant that lets you style your site differently when dark mode is enabled

By default this uses `Appearance.getColorScheme()` on native and `prefers-color-scheme` on web.

:::caution

Expo apps do not follow the system appearance unless `userInterfaceStyle` is set to automatic. [Please see the Expo docs for more information.](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/color-schemes/)

## Toggling dark mode manually

To manualy toggle dark mode on web, you will need to enable the [`class` strategy](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually).

```tsx title="tailwind.config.js"
module.exports = {
  darkMode: "class",
  // ...
};
```

React Native Web does not support `Appearance.setColorScheme`, so we recommend you either use:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { colorScheme, useColorScheme } from "nativewind";

// Use imperatively
colorScheme.set("dark" | "light" | "system");

export default function App() {
  // Or as a hook
  const { setColorScheme } = useColorScheme();
  setColorScheme("dark" | "light" | "system");
}
```

## Supporting system preference and manual selection

You can follows the [Supporting system preference and manual selection](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#supporting-system-preference-and-manual-selection) instructions to support both system preference and manual selection. Instead of `localstorage`, we recommend using universal storage solution such as [React Native Async Storage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/)
