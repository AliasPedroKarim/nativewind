# Animation

## Usage

<Usage />

:::caution

Animation support is experimental!

NativeWind uses `react-native-reanimated` on native for its animation driver. You will need to follow the `react-native-reanimated` [installation steps](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/#installation)

## Compatibility

<Compatibility
  experimental={[
    "animate-none",
    "animate-spin",
    "animate-ping",
    "animate-bounce",
    "animate-[n]",
  ]}
/>

## Contributors

NativeWind's animation is still experimental and very basic. We are looking for contributors to help with

- Animated all mapped props (currently only works with `style`)
- Improve performance
- Update code to support new Reanimated v3 features (currently written in v2 style)
